Allow customers to create a custom user profile for their rewards account, and grant them access to tools and dashboards that help them make better decisions, provide convenient and relevant offers and recipes.

Recommend recipes and healthy choices to customers. Through nifty visualizations, allow customers to explore their own behavior patterns, nutritional intake, where their food comes from, and customize their recommendations based on dietary preference and restrictions.
